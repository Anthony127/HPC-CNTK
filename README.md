# HPC-CNTK
An exploration into High Performance Deep Learning as a method to scale up and invesitgate performance of large Deep Learning Models being trained across multiple GPU and CPU nodes on OSC's Owens Cluster

# Overview of Content
This repository contains the findings of the group assigned the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK for short) for The Ohio State University's CSE 5194.01 course, Introduction to High-Performance Deep Learning found here: http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~panda.2/5194/
This repository does not include coded examples, as the preimplemented models are provided here: https://github.com/microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Examples/Image/Classification
However, the models used were AlexNet, ResNet, and VGG16 in both their single node and distributed runtime fashions, also included is the Lab reports documenting the findings of the group over the course of the Autumn '19 semester.
